# MalikSaadHayat

yeah this is just a quick portfolio thing i threw together because i needed it for something

üåê **Live:** [malik-saad-hayat.vercel.app](https://malik-saad-hayat.vercel.app)

## what it is
- basic portfolio site
- nothing fancy
- gets the job done i guess

## tech stack
- typescript (91.5%)
- html/css/js
- tailwind (because why not)
- vite for bundling or whatever
- vercel for deployment

## setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## todo (maybe)
- [ ] actually make it look good
- [ ] add proper animations 
- [ ] rewrite the whole thing in threejs when i have time
- [ ] fix whatever's broken (probably everything)

## notes
this was made in like 2 hours so don't expect much. planning to redo it properly with threejs later when i'm not rushing

if you're here from my job application or something, the real portfolio is coming soon‚Ñ¢
